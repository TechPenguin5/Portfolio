# Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), bootstrapped using [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

It showcases my projects, skills, and background as a developer, and serves as a central place for anyone to learn more about my work.

## Getting Started

To run the development server locally:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
